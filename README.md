# hello-world
Github teaching me things.

My name is Mark, I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of Maryland College Park.  I've heard talk of how awesome GitHub is so I decided to check it out!
Thanks GitHub for the awesome tutorial, it's very clear and I definitely needed it!
